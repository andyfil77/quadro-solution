# _A program that solves quadratic equations_
A user who wants to get the roots of a quadratic equation submits 3 numbers (not necessarily integers) __to the program input - a, b, —Å__.
___The program is written in a programming language C___.
## The program works very quickly, you will get the answer in a decimal number of the float type with two decimal places.
* __Tasks that are planned to be included in the program in the future__
  * Solving integrals
  * Solving cubic equations (equations of higher degrees)
  * Graphical interpretation of the equation
#_Why my program?_
__My program is written clearly, there are no errors, there is protection from incomprehensible input data.__
#_Testing program_
The program has a __testing program__ that checks its performance on _4 complex tests_. Before using the program, you must show the program exactly what you are going to do: 1 - a _test_, any other input data - solve a _quadratic equation_.
